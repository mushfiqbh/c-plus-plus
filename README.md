## 🚀 Topics Covered

- **C++ Basics**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and pointers.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.).
- **Competitive Programming**: Problem-solving techniques and solutions to various coding problems.
- **Projects**: Small projects to reinforce concepts with real-world applications.
